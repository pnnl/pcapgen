PCAP Generation
=============

It's some stuff to generate PCAP files.

hkgen was an earlier attempt at this,
which only worked for the hk protocol (and the xmodem protocol).

This has been rearchitected to be simpler to understand and use.

Initially the goal is just to recreate netarch core 25000,
as close as possible to the original puzzle.
Then I'll make some follow-on puzzles that are more challenging.
